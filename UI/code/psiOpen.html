Welcome to the PSI budgeting interface, a tool that helps data depositors release privacy preserving statistics describing a dataset by distributing a “privacy budget” across different possible statistical calculations. Privacy is ensured by carefully introducing noise into the statistical releases, with noisier answers corresponding to greater privacy. Users select which statistics they would like to calculate and are given estimates of how accurately each statistic can be computed at the assigned level of privacy. They can also redistribute their privacy budget according to which statistics they think are most valuable in their dataset.  
<p>
Some of the statistics require additional information about variables in the dataset. For example, when releasing a mean, a lower and upper bound for the variable is requested.  It is important to fill in such metadata with plausible values without actually referencing the raw data. Think of this as the values you might expect the variable to take on before every collecting the data (sometimes called a dataset schema). For example, 0-100 is a reasonable range for an age variable and is a safer response than looking up the youngest and oldest people in the dataset.
